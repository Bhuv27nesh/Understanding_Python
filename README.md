This repository is my Python learning journey through the freeCodeCamp Python course (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/python-v9/ ). It includes hands-on projects and practical exercises related to each topic, helping me strengthen my problem-solving skills and apply Python concepts through real implementations.
