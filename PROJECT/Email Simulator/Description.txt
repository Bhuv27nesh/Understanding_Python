This program is a simple object-oriented email simulator built in Python. It demonstrates how users can send, receive, read, and delete emails using classes and methods.

🔹 1. Email Class
The Email class represents an individual email.
It stores:
sender and receiver (User objects)
subject and body
timestamp (current date and time)
read status (True/False)
Key features:
mark_as_read() updates the email status.
display_full_email() prints complete email details and marks it as read.
__str__() provides a short formatted summary showing read/unread status, sender, subject, and time.

🔹 2. Inbox Class
The Inbox class manages a list of received emails.
It provides methods to:
receive_email() → Add a new email to the inbox.
list_emails() → Display all emails with numbering.
read_email(index) → Show full email content (with validation).
delete_email(index) → Remove an email safely using index validation.

🔹 3. User Class
The User class represents a user with:
A name
An Inbox object
It allows users to:
send_email() → Create and send an email with confirmation.
check_inbox() → View inbox contents.
read_email(index) → Read a specific email.
delete_email(index) → Delete a specific email.

🔹 4. Main Function
The main() function demonstrates the system:
Creates two users: Tory and Ramy.
Simulates sending emails between them.
Ramy checks his inbox.
Reads the first email.
Deletes it.
Checks his inbox again to see the update.

✅ Overall Concept
The program showcases:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Class interaction
Encapsulation
Method delegation
Index validation
Basic user feedback
Timestamp handling with datetime
